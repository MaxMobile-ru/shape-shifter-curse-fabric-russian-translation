Underneath, your hands and feet structure becomes more feline - retractable claws and cushioning pads\nWhile lengthening, your tail grows more flexible and powerful. It helps mid-air balance but increasingly affects your walking/running posture"],
  "codex.form.ocelot1.pros": ["Your claws become deadly, dealing heavy damage barehanded and letting you climb trees and leaves freely\nThe longer tail helps balance when crouching, allowing near-running sneaking speed and unimpeded jumping\nYour footsteps become nearly silent\nYour digestive system strengthens - fresh raw meat provides more satiation, rotten flesh won't cause hunger\nCreepers avoid you\nYou excel at mid-air posture adjustment, preventing fall damage from any height"],

Below threshold, you can't maintain stance\n\nDigitigrade hind legs make bipedal sprinting impossible\nBecoming smaller and lighter further reduces max health\nAs a swift lethal hunter, you can only wear leather/chainmail.
